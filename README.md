# GAPID: **G**raphics **API** **D**ebugger

GAPID is a collection of tools that allows you to inspect, tweak and replay GPU command streams captured from any Android application.

GAPID consists of the following sub-components:

### GAPI**I**: Graphics API Interceptor
A layer that sits between the application / game and the GPU driver, recording all the calls and memory accesses.

### GAPI**S**: Graphics API Server
A process that analyses capture streams reporting incorrect API usage, processes the data for replay on various target devices, and provides an RPC interface to the client.

### GAPI**R**: Graphics API Replay daemon
A stack-based VM used to playback capture files, imitating the original applicationâ€™s / game's calls to the GPU driver. Supports read-back of any buffer / framebuffer, and provides profiling functionality.

### GAPI**C**: Graphics API Client
The frontend user interface application. Provides visual inspection of the capture data, memory, resources, and frame-buffer content.

### GAPI**L**: Graphics API Language
A new domain specific language to describe a graphics API in its entirety. Combined with our template system to generate huge parts of the interceptor, server and replay systems.

### APIC: The API compiler
Used to validate and format API files, and when combined with templates, used to generate code.
